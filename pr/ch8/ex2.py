# Exercise 2: Figure out which line of the above program is still not
# properly guarded. See if you can construct a text file which causes the
# program to fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly
# guarded and test it to make sure it handles your new text file.

# Exercise 3: Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without
# two if statements. Instead, use a compound logical expression using
# the or logical operator with a single if statement.

count = 0
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
# print('Debug:', words)
    if len(words) == 0 or words[0] != 'From' : continue
    count = count + 1
    print(words[2])
print('Count: ', count)
